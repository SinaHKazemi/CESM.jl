# Modeling to Generate Alternatives

Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA) is a mathematical modeling approach that finds multiple, diverse, yet nearly optimal solutions to a given optimization problem.

In linear programming, one "best" solution is typically found that minimizes cost or maximizes profit.

However, in real-world decision-making, stakeholders often want to see different feasible options that differ structurally yet are almost as good as the optimal one â€” for example, different energy mixes, infrastructure layouts, or policy combinations.

MGA explores the solution space to find alternatives that are near-optimal yet diverse in their decision variables.
