# Model Concepts

- What we can model using the model ?
- What are the outputs of the model ?
- What are the components of the model ?
- What are the main assumptions of the model ? equiliburium of the energy carriers
- Planning years, time steps and how they are connected

## Equilibrium of the Energy Carriers

all the energy carriers are in equilibrium

## Boundries of the Model

Dummy Carrier
